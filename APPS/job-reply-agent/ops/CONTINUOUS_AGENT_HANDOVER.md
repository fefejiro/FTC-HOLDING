# JobAgent Continuous Handover

## Last Verified State

- Updated: 2026-08-10 17:27 America/New_York
- Engineering branch: `agent/job-agent-continuous`
- Recorded parent HEAD: `53c6e3be3 Add JobAgent mobile and Codex agent foundation`;
  verify the current HEAD because the handover commit follows it
- Draft PR: `https://github.com/fefejiro/FTC-HOLDING/pull/192`
- Autonomous worktree: `D:\FTC-HOLDING-worktrees\job-agent-continuous`
- Autonomous branch: `agent/job-agent-continuous`
- Windows task: `JobReplyAgent-Product-Continuous`
- Task policy: every 6 hours, no overlap, 45-minute limit, maximum two model
  runs per day, product engineering only
- Last task result: `0` after the daily-cap safety check

This file is a resumable evidence record, not a claim that every external
connector or production release gate is complete. Verify drift-prone runtime
facts before changing them.

## Completed In The Latest Increment

- Added four project-scoped Codex agents under `C:\FTC HOLDING\.codex\agents`:
  product builder, mobile publisher, connector operator, and read-only trust
  release auditor. Codex must reload the FTC workspace before discovery updates.
- Added Capacitor 8 Android and iOS projects for the existing responsive hosted
  product, using application ID `cloud.unalabs.jobagent`.
- Added exact-origin native navigation, system-browser OAuth handoff, app resume
  refresh, Android App Links, and iOS Associated Domains.
- Kept OAuth secrets, browser cookies, and job-board automation outside the
  mobile binary.
- Fixed `src/main.ts` so parser imports no longer execute the operational CLI.
- Added focused mobile security/configuration tests and a mobile release runbook.
- Added `docs/NEXT_DEVELOPER_HANDOVER.md` with setup, ownership, verification,
  safety boundaries, and ordered release gates.
- Quoted Vitest exclude globs so Linux CI does not expand `node_modules/**` into
  test-file filters.

## Verification Evidence

- Final focused CLI/mobile/PWA Vitest suite: `3` files and `13` tests passed.
- Full Vitest suite after the CLI import fix: `28` files passed, `1` skipped;
  `210` tests passed, `8` skipped, with a successful process exit.
- The quoted-glob `npm test --workspaces=false` command passed locally; Linux CI
  then passed clean install, audit, static checks, compile/lint, and all tests.
- The next strict CI step exposed missing synthetic `BACKUP_DATABASE_URL` and
  `BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` fixture values. The workflow now supplies a distinct
  backup role and a 32-byte test key; require its rerun before calling CI green.
- Gitleaks 8.28 identified one false positive in historical release evidence:
  a Cloudflare deployment UUID immediately followed `API routes. Version:`.
  The wording now identifies the value as a deployment UUID, preserving the
  evidence while allowing the application-tree scan to pass locally.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- `npm run lint`: passed.
- `npm run production:check`: passed in static mode with only the expected
  deployment-environment warning.
- Application-local `npm audit --workspaces=false --omit=dev --audit-level=high`:
  passed with `0` vulnerabilities. The unscoped monorepo audit is a different
  root lockfile and must not be used as this application's release result.
- Credential-pattern scan of the new native/configuration surface: no matches.
- `npm run mobile:sync`: passed for Android and iOS with Capacitor 8.5.
- `npm run mobile:doctor`: Android passed; the combined command returned
  nonzero only because Xcode is not installed on this Windows host.
- Android API 36 debug build: passed, producing a 4,367,917-byte APK with SHA-256
  `549163DE15F12E47CE48E4F94E122C32BB6552BFBD5C76F0970988FB805A31D3`.
- Android `apksigner` verification: passed with one v2 debug signer.
- iOS source generation/sync: passed; no Xcode, simulator, device, archive, or
  TestFlight test was available on Windows.
- Strict deployment-environment release checks were not run in this increment.
- No recruiter email, job application, browser action, deployment, DNS change,
  secret change, billing action, or production mutation occurred.

## Current Boundaries And Manual Gates

- The scheduled product agent runs only while the Windows computer is on and
  the configured user has an interactive session.
- The branch is pushed to `origin/agent/job-agent-continuous`; the unattended
  task still does not push future commits automatically.
- Gmail OAuth, authenticated job-board proof runs, deployment operations, and
  candidate actions remain separate explicitly authorized workflows.
- Public beta expansion still depends on external and pilot gates documented in
  `PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- App/Universal Link association files are not yet deployed and device-verified.
- Native signing, final icons, screenshots, privacy declarations, Play internal
  testing, TestFlight, and store reviews remain open.
- The C drive filled during the first Android dependency download. Repeat Gradle
  builds should set `GRADLE_USER_HOME`, `TEMP`, and `TMP` to a D-drive directory.

## Next Highest-Impact Work

1. Add responsive Playwright coverage for match explanations, ATS gap reports,
   application timelines, interview preparation, and approvals on mobile and
   desktop.
2. Publish exact-domain Android/Apple association files, then prove OAuth return
   on an Android device and an iOS device without exposing tokens in URLs/logs.
3. Replace placeholder native artwork and complete signed internal-test builds.
4. Audit queue idempotency, lease recovery, and dead-letter operator visibility.

## Resume Command

In the FTC workspace, select **JobAgent Continuous Operator**, invoke
`/jobagent-continue`, and optionally replace the Optional Override line.

For a direct scheduled-run preflight without model invocation:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File `
  "D:\FTC-HOLDING-worktrees\job-agent-continuous\APPS\job-reply-agent\scripts\continuous-agent-run.ps1" `

```

## Update Contract

Every interactive or scheduled product-engineering run must update this file
before its final commit. Replace stale evidence rather than stacking optimistic
claims. Keep completed, deployed, externally verified, paused, and blocked
states distinct.
